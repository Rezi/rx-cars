# rx cars

Educational material for learning reactiveX in a visual way. Rx operators are animated and visualized in form of cars on road, including traffic lights etc.

With Rx cars, rx operators are easy to understand.

More implemented animation for more operators will be added over time.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
